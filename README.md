* NOTE: I run Java 9 so I cannot guarantee that it will work on earlier version, but I don't believe I've used anything preventing it from running on some older versions. Click [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html) to download Java 9.

Graphics driver must have support for OpenGL 3.3 Core or later

### What's this all about?
This project is my game for Ludum Dare 40. If you don't know what [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/about) is and you're into making games then definitely check it out [here](https://ldjam.com/about).

### So what's the game?
The game is a snake inspired game in which you control a snake and navigate though levels to reach the end.

### Can I play it?
Of course! Here's how:

Click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CPgHTXhfeaYPd9OUWtnpnup5hiO7CTq2?usp=sharing) to download the game. Once you've downloaded it extract the zip file and run the jar file.

Of course you can always download the source and compile it yourself. You are going to need [LWJGL 3](https://www.lwjgl.org/download). Make sure to include JOML under **Addons**
